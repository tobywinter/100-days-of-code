**Today's Progress**: Migrated production build of Playthru app from Heroku to Now

**Thoughts:** Getting the client up and running on now was almost as simple as one command but the GraphQL endpoint was a struggle and needed more config because it uses Apollo - which wasn't well documented on the Zeit/Now docs. Ended up being a frustratingly small change to the routing that was the last hurdle we eventually got right. (Paired with JackBittiner)
